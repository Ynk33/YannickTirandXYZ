      description: Nimrod is a unified backend designed to manage game libraries such as Jeux.com. It is a REST API built with Laravel, designed to be used by frontends such as Jeux.com and other game platforms.

      description: Alumnforce is a SaaS platform designed to help alumni associations manage their members and events. It used to be built with Zend as monolithic backend, but I worked on shifting it to a more modern architecture using Laravel with each feature designed as a service to easily build a tailored product for each client. This transition improved its scalability and maintainability, allowing for the addition of new features and better performance, while also reducing the heavy technical debt of the old solution.

      description: A team of three, we co-founded Gravity Goat to create hyper-casual mobile games. Working with world-leading publishers, we had to deliver several high-quality prototypes each month. To cope with the fast-paced environment, we built our own toolsets to accelerate our iteration speed and set up CI processes to automate our builds. We also created several custom Unity packages to share our tools and assets across all our projects. My deep knowledge in software engineering allowed me to efficiently design and implement these tools, ensuring they were robust and easy to use for the entire team.

      description: While being on professional hiatus, I worked on several personal projects to stay up to date with the latest technologies. YankaForge is a headless Wordpress theme designed to use the powerful Wordpress back-office as a REST API. Yankify is a NextJS frontend that consumes the YankaForge API to create a fast and responsive website. Alongside those projects, I also created a set of tools based on NodeJS and the Github API to accelerate the development and the deployment of projects based on YankaForge and Yankify.
